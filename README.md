Precision Baking: AI for Accurate Ingredient Measurement in Grams

Overview

Online recipe platforms often list ingredients in vague measurements like "cups" or "spoons," leading to inconsistent results, especially in professional baking. This lack of precision frustrates bakers and affects the quality of their baked goods.

To solve this, we implemented a platform that:

Converts various measurement units to precise grams.

Analyzes YouTube recipe videos using video links to generate an exact recipe sheet with ingredient measurements in grams.

Generates a recipe by simply entering a dish name.

Utilizes Gemini AI via app calls to provide human-like assistance to bakers through text and camera inputs.

Features

Unit Conversion: Converts measurements (cups, spoons, etc.) into accurate grams.

YouTube Recipe Analysis: Extracts and structures ingredient measurements from YouTube videos.

AI-Powered Recipe Generation: Generates detailed recipes based on dish names.

Gemini AI Integration: Offers an intelligent assistant for bakers via camera and text-based interactions.
